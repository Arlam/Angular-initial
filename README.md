# app-template

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

The purpose of the template is to speed up a development process on a new project. 
Common interceptors are configured in the project.
It contains basic features that are used by almost all projects I have been working on. 
It has everything to help with security implementation including jwt library, 
contains simple docker file and simple proxy configuration.
The project already have angular material and angular flex-layout dependencies. 

There are still areas to be covered:
- Unit tests
- logging
- Token refresh
- Password reset
- ...

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
